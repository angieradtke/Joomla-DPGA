# Collection of Personal Data in the Joomla Community

The Joomla community collects personal data at various points — especially wherever users interact with the platform or participate in the project. On official Joomla websites such as joomla.org, extensions.joomla.org, volunteers.joomla.org, and forum.joomla.org, users are asked to provide personal information when registering an account. This includes name, email address, username, profile image, and possibly IP address. These details enable participation in forums, submission of extensions, team membership, and other community functions.

When submitting extensions via the Joomla Extensions Directory (JED) or contributing to project teams through volunteers.joomla.org, additional information may be collected — such as project affiliations, website links, or user activity logs. Personal information is also collected when subscribing to newsletters, participating in surveys or events, or applying for roles within the Joomla community. This may include location, motivation, or relevant background details.

## **Confidential Communication with Teams**

Particularly sensitive data may be collected when users contact official Joomla teams such as the Conflict Resolution Team (CRT). These communications typically occur via email or a confidential form. Users may voluntarily provide their name (optional), email address, description of the incident, and any attachments. All submitted information is treated confidentially and used exclusively to resolve the reported issue.

## **Technical Log Data**

When accessing joomla.org or related websites, technical data such as IP address, browser type, and access time is automatically recorded. This data is used to ensure proper functionality, error analysis, and security monitoring — but not for profiling or tracking individuals.

## **Third-Party Services**

Joomla websites may incorporate third-party services such as Google reCAPTCHA, YouTube embeds, or newsletter tools. These services may collect data such as IP addresses or user behavior, according to their own privacy policies.

Joomla is committed to handling personal data responsibly and transparently. The full priacy policy is available here: [https://www.joomla.org/privacy-policy.html](https://www.joomla.org/privacy-policy.html)

## Data Collection During Downloads and Updates

When downloading Joomla from the official website, no personal data is required. The download process is anonymous, although technical metadata (e.g., IP address, browser type, and timestamp) may be recorded in server logs for security and debugging purposes — but not for identifying individuals.

When updating Joomla via the administrator backend, the CMS communicates with Joomla’s official update servers. In this process, limited technical information is transmitted, including:

* Current Joomla version

* PHP version

* Server configuration

* Language settings

These details are necessary to ensure that the correct and compatible update files are delivered. No personal data, such as names or email addresses, is transmitted.

Likewise, if the Joomla Statistics Plugin is enabled, users may voluntarily share additional telemetry data (e.g., installed extensions, server type). This information helps developers improve Joomla but does not contain personal identifiers.

## **Conclusion**:

No personal data is automatically collected during downloads or updates unless the user explicitly consents or manually provides information.
