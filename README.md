  <h1>Sustainability and Joomla</h1>
  <p>Joomla is a free, modular, and widely used open-source (GPL) Content Management System (CMS). Due to its architecture, active community, and extendability, Joomla is well-suited for implementing sustainable software principles.</p>
  <p>An essential aspect of Joomla’s sustainability is its global community, which contributes to development, support, localization, and dissemination. The community fosters knowledge sharing, promotes inclusive participation, and ensures long-term viability through collaborative governance and volunteer-driven innovation.</p>
  <p><em>Or shorter:</em> A key aspect of Joomla’s sustainability is its global community, which supports development and growth through collaboration and volunteer-driven efforts.</p>

  <h2>1. Technical Principles in Joomla</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Joomla is built on modules, components, and plugins. Only necessary features are activated, reducing resource consumption and improving performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> Joomla runs on various OS and web servers (Apache, Nginx, IIS) and supports multiple databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL).</li>
    <li><strong>Open Interfaces and Data Formats:</strong> Supports JSON, XML, RSS and offers a REST API for integration.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimalism:</strong> The core is lightweight. Extra functionality is added via extensions.</li>
    <li><strong>Security and Automatic Updates:</strong> Joomla’s Security Team handles patches and vulnerabilities. Automatic updates improve stability and reduce manual effort.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Energy and Resource Efficiency in Joomla</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Built-in caching, gzip compression, CDN support. <em>Note: CDNs may raise data protection/political concerns.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Resource Monitoring:</strong> Extensions and the debug function help with diagnostics.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage Efficiency:</strong> Lean media management and cleanup tools reduce data bloat.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimized Data Transmission:</strong> Joomla supports image compression, lazy loading, and JS/CSS minification and bundling.</li>
    <li><strong>Dark Mode in Backend:</strong> Reduces eye strain and can save energy on OLED/AMOLED screens.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Transparency and Knowledge in the Joomla Community</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Open Source Code & Development:</strong> Full codebase is open on GitHub under GPL. Third-party libraries are GPL-compatible.</li>
    <li><strong>Documentation & Knowledge Sharing:</strong> Community-maintained docs, guides, and manuals.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrated Help:</strong> Joomla Guided Tours help beginners navigate the backend.</li>
    <li><strong>Global Best Practice Exchange:</strong> JUGs, forums, Mattermost, and Joomla Magazine foster collaboration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Social Responsibility Through Open Source</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Backend meets WCAG 2.2 guidelines.</li>
        <li>Frontend accessibility depends on template development – Joomla provides semantic markup and tools.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Multilingual Support:</strong> Built-in multilingual system supports nearly all languages in both frontend and backend.</li>
    <li><strong>Digital Inclusion:</strong> Being free and open-source lowers barriers for NGOs, schools, and Global South users.</li>
    <li><strong>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):</strong> Joomla and its developers promote energy-efficient development. <em>Further documentation may be needed.</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Protection and Privacy in Joomla</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Privacy by Design & GDPR:</strong> Tools for data export, consent, cookie control, and data deletion are included.</li>
    <li><strong>Secure Data Transmission and Storage:</strong> HTTPS is supported by default. Extensions provide 2FA and encryption.</li>
    <li><strong>Mobile Data Optimization:</strong> Joomla can be extended to support low-bandwidth environments (e.g., caching, lazy loading, minify CSS/JS, gzip, CDN). <em>Missing features can be added via extensions.</em></li>
  </ul>
