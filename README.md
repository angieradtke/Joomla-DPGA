# Joomla ! Sustainability and UN 2030 Agenda



Joomla! is a powerful, free,accessible  and open-source Content Management System (CMS) and application framework, developed by a global community of volunteers to build professional websites and web applications.

 It is modular, multilingual, accessible, and secure—making it a sustainable digital tool that can be used by individuals, NGOs, educational institutions, and governments worldwide. Joomla encourages knowledge sharing, promotes inclusion, and supports responsible digital infrastructure development.

Thanks to its community-driven governance, open licensing (GPL), and strong focus on privacy, accessibility, and energy efficiency, Joomla actively contributes to creating fairer access to digital technology and lifelong learning.

These values directly support several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including:

* **SDG 4**:  
   Quality Education – through open learning resources, interactive guides, and global knowledge exchange  
* **SDG 5:**   
  Gender Equality – by providing inclusive tools and lowering digital access barriers  
*  **SDG 9:**  
   Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure – by offering a sustainable, open-source platform for digital innovation  
* **SDG 10:**   
  Reduced Inequalities – through multilingual support and accessibility by default  
* **SDG 13**:   
  Climate Action – by encouraging lightweight, efficient web design and remote collaboration  
* **SDG 16:**   
  Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions – via transparent governance and community empowerment  
* **SDG 17:**   
  Partnerships for the Goals – through global cooperation and best-practice sharing within the Joomla ecosystem

Joomla is not just a CMS—it’s a sustainable digital foundation built to serve communities and advance global development in line with the UN 2030 Agenda.
