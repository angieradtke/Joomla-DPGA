# **Joomla\! Ownership**

Joomla\! is a content management system and a powerful application Framework released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This means that Joomla can be used, modified, and distributed freely. The software is developed by the Joomla\! Project, a global community of people who continuously work to improve the system. 

Joomla\!’s success story began with the release of version 1.0 on September 16, 2005\. Since then, it has grown into one of the world’s most widely used CMS platforms, supported by a passionate worldwide community of developers, designers, translators, and users.

Joomla\! is not controlled by any single company; it’s an open-source project backed by a non-profit organisation, Open Source Matters (OSM). This governance structure has proven resilient. In 2017, Joomla underwent a major governance overhaul, merging its formerly separate leadership teams (for production, community, etc.) into one unified structure under a board of directors. Today, Joomla is governed by a board with representatives from various departments and officers, all of whom are community-elected volunteers. This democratic, community-driven governance ensures that Joomla’s directions are guided by its users and contributors, rather than corporate agendas. It also spreads responsibility across a large group, reducing reliance on any one individual. 

## **OSM – The Management Behind the Scenes**

Open Source Matters (OSM) is a non-profit organisation that exists to protect, support, and manage the Joomla\! project. It provides a solid legal, financial, and organisational foundation to help Joomla\! grow and operate as a free and open-source content management system (CMS). OSM was established to ensure that Joomla\! has long-term stability and community-driven governance. OSM is based in the United States and works closely with the Joomla community and various project teams.
