<h1 id="joomla-documentation">Joomla! Documentation</h1>
<h2 id="everyone-can-participate">Everyone Can Participate</h2>
<p>The Joomla documentation is available online at <a href="https://docs.joomla.org">https://docs.joomla.org</a>. It is a <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> based, multilingual, open source documentation platform. It contains almost 10,000 articles, with translations in more than 30 languages.  It is a collaborative effort of thousands (!) of people from the global Joomla community. Since the Joomla documentation was set up in January 2008, more than 1,2 million page edits have been made. Translations have been managed by translation teams.</p>
<h2 id="developers-manual-and-user-guides">Developers Manual and User Guides</h2>
<p>To make the enormous amount of information more efficiently available Joomla is moving away from the wiki and is building different types of documentation aimed at various audiences. The main division is documentation for developers and for users. </p>
<p>For <strong>developers</strong>, there is a dedicated Developer Documentation. It includes technical references, API descriptions, and guides for developing extensions such as components, modules, plugins, or templates. Developers find important information about Joomla!’s architecture and best practices to create clean and compatible extensions. The Developer Documentation is available at <a href="https://manual.joomla.org/docs/">https://manual.joomla.org/docs/</a> </p>
<p>The content of the developers manual is hosted on GitHub. There, developers can propose changes. The repository can be found at <a href="https://github.com/joomla/Manual">https://github.com/joomla/Manual</a>. The content is rendered with the open source package <a href="https://docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a>.</p>
<p>For <strong>users</strong> and administrators, there are User Guides, which explain step-by-step how to install, configure, and operate Joomla!. These guides contain easy-to-understand instructions and tips, especially helpful for beginners but also valuable for advanced users who want to deepen their understanding. The User Guides are being developed on <a href="https://www.jdocmanual.org/">https://www.jdocmanual.org/</a>  and <a href="https://docs-core.sandbox.joomla.org/">https://docs-core.sandbox.joomla.org/</a>. Both are Joomla sites.</p>
<p>The structured documentation for target groups is first built in English and will be translated in multiple languages in a next stage. JDocManual is already translated in nine languages. </p>
<h2 id="license-of-the-documentation">License of the documentation</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.joomla.org/JEDL">The Joomla! Electronic Documentation License</a> (JEDL) grants users the rights to freely copy, distribute, and publicly share Joomla! documentation. Users are allowed to modify the documentation, but any modified versions must be clearly identified as such to avoid confusion with the original work. Proper attribution is required, meaning the original author or source of the documentation must always be credited.</p>
<p>License rights are only applicable for the distribution of documentation through electronic media, such as websites, electronic books, or other digital formats. Permission to publish a printed version of the documentation must be separately requested and is not part of this license.</p>
<p>The JEDL fosters open collaboration and sharing of Joomla! documentation while maintaining proper attribution and allowing the Joomla! community to maintain authoritative and up-to-date resources. Some <a href="https://docs.joomla.org/JEDL/FAQ/en">Frequently Asked Questions about the JEDL</a> are answered in the documentation.</p>
<p>The license itself is copyright 2007 Open Source Matters, Inc.</p>
<h2 id="documentation-related-information-available-in-the-joomla-backend">Documentation related information available in the Joomla! backend</h2>
<p>Every page in Joomla’s backend has a help button, which leads to context-sensitive help texts directly in the administration area, so users can quickly find explanations of features and settings without leaving the site. About 200 <strong>help pages</strong> are available. Those help pages are automatically displayed in the language the user uses for their browser. At the moment those help pages are available in nine languages: English, German, Italian, Russian, Brazilian Portuguese, Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish and French. English is used as a fallback in all other cases.</p>
<p>Another helpful resource is the <strong>Guided Tours</strong> available in the Joomla! backend. These interactive tours lead users step-by-step through important backend functions. Guided Tours are especially useful for newcomers to familiarize themselves with the interface but also offer experienced users a quick refresher on essential workflows. They help make complex processes clear and manageable.</p>
<p>In forms <strong>inline descriptions</strong> are used to explain the use of a field. The labels and descriptions of the form fields are part of every Joomla CMS language package. Joomla 5.x comes with 64 accredited language packs that can be installed directly from the backend.</p>
<h2 id="helping-each-other-on-the-forum-and-on-mattermost">Helping each other on the Forum and on Mattermost</h2>
<p>Any problem that cannot be solved with the documentation, can be searched for or asked on the Joomla <a href="https://forum.joomla.org">forum</a>. It is publicly accessible. Help is also available on Joomla’s internal communications channel on <a href="https://docs.joomla.org/Mattermost">Mattermost</a>.</p>
