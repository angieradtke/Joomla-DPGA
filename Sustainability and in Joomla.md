# **Sustainability  and in Joomla**

Joomla is a free, modular, and widely used open-source ( GPL) Content Management System (CMS) and Application Framework. Due to its architecture, active community, and extendability, Joomla is well-suited for implementing sustainable software principles. This overview presents key sustainability criteria in the context of Joomla, aligning with ecological, social, and technical goals.

An essential aspect of Joomla’s sustainability is its global community, which contributes continuously to the development, support, localization, and dissemination of the platform. The community fosters knowledge sharing, promotes inclusive participation, and ensures long-term viability through collaborative governance and volunteer-driven innovation.

## **1\. Technical Principles in Joomla**

* **Modularity : The fundamental concept**  
  Joomla is built on modules, components, and plugins. Only the features that are actually needed can be installed and activated, reducing resource consumption and improving performance.  
   	  
* **Platform Independence**  
  Joomla runs on various operating systems and web servers (Apache, Nginx, IIS) and supports multiple databases (MySQL,Maria DB,  PostgreSQL).  
   	  
* **Open Interfaces and Data Formats**  
  Joomla supports open standards like JSON, XML, and RSS. Its REST API allows for cross-system integration.  
   	 	  
* **Minimalism ("Less is More")**  
  The core system is lightweight. Additional functionality is added only as needed through extensions.

* **Security and Automatic Updates**  
  The Joomla Security Team actively monitors threats, coordinates disclosures, and issues timely patches to keep sites protected. Automatic updates also reduce manual effort and errors. Joomla  automatic updates improve website security and sustainability by quickly closing vulnerabilities and enhancing system stability.

* **Reliable Software: More than 20 Years of Continuous Development**  
  Joomla was first released in 2005 (forked from the Mambo CMS), and it has seen a steady stream of improvements and major releases since then.  Part of Joomla’s longevity is due to its ability to adapt. Over the years, Joomla’s core code has been rewritten or refactored to embrace new technology trends (from PHP 4 to onwards, from procedural to modern PHP with namespaces). 

* **Longterm-Version Support:**  
  Joomla’s maintenance policy supports each major release for a defined period, and clearly communicates End-of-Life (EOL) dates

* **Joomla  Framework**  
  Besides the CMS, Joomla maintains the Joomla Framework—a set of modular PHP packages usable independently (e.g., HTTP or Database libraries). This modular design follows the DRY principle, enabling code reuse and interoperability with other PHP apps, benefiting long-term maintenance beyond the Joomla CMS.

## **2\. Energy and Resource Efficiency in Joomla**

* **Performance Optimization**  
  Joomla includes built-in caching, gzip compression, and supports Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)  to improve speed and efficiency.  
   	  
* **Resource Monitoring**  
  Extensions and the integrated debug function provide system diagnostic and database usage.  
   	  
* **Storage Efficiency**  
  Joomla allows for database optimization and lean media management. Automated cleanup can reduce unnecessary data accumulation.  
   	  
* **Minimized Data Transmission**  
  Features like image compression, lazy loading, CSS/JS minification and bundling are supported to reduce network load.
* **Dark Mode in the Backend – Small Feature, Noticeable Impact**   
    Joomla offers a dark mode in the backend that not only reduces eye strain but can also contribute to energy savings – especially on devices with OLED or AMOLED displays.

## **3\. Transparency and Knowledge in the Joomla Community**

* **Open Source Code & Development**  
  Joomla is fully open source (GPL license). The entire codebase is available on GitHub and publicly maintained. All third-party libraries use open source licenses that are compatible with the GNU General Public License (GPL). 	

* **Documentation & Knowledge Sharing**  
  Joomla provides extensive public documentation, developer guides, and user 	manuals, all maintained by a global community. This includes step-by-step guides, FAQs, developer tutorials, and version-specific instructions. New users can learn everything from installing Joomla to securing their site, while developers find API references and extension-building guides. 

* **Integrated Help: Joomla Guided Tours** are interactive step-by-step tutorials built into the Joomla backend. They help users navigate and understand various features and workflows directly within the interface.This feature is especially useful for beginners and new content editors, making it easier for them to get started with Joomla. 	

* **Global Best Practice Exchange**  
  Joomla User Groups (JUGs), Joomladays, forums, the Mattermost-Community and the Joomla Magazine foster worldwide knowledge sharing and sustainable development practices.

## **4\. Social Responsibility Through Open Source**

* **Accessibility**  
  Joomla places a strong emphasis on accessibility.  
  ▸ The **backend** is designed to be **accessible by default**, 	meeting most of the current WCAG  guidelines.  
  ▸ The **frontend (templates)** *can* be highly accessible and 	high-performing **if developed accordingly**. Joomla provides the technical foundation (e.g. semantic markup, override system), but accessibility in the frontend depends on the **skills 	and awareness of template developers**. The Joomla community 	encourages accessible template design through best practices and accessibility testing tools.  
   	  
* **Multilingual Support**  
  Joomla includes built-in multilingual functionality in the core system without the need for external plugins. \- for almost all languages worldwide in frontend and backend.  
   	  
* **Digital Inclusion Through Free Access**  
  Being free and open-source, Joomla lowers entry barriers for NGOs, 	educational institutions, and users in the Global South.

## **5\. Data Protection and Privacy in Joomla**

* **Privacy by Design & GDPR Compliance**  
  Joomla includes tools for data export, user consent management, cookie 	controls, and deletion of personal data.  
   	  
* **Secure Data Transmission and Storage**  
  Joomla supports HTTPS out of the box, and extensions can add encryption for 	forms and Multi-factor authentication (MFA).  
   	  
* **Mobile Data Optimization (customizable)**  
  While not native, Joomla can be customized or extended to reduce data 	transfer over mobile networks and optimize for low-bandwidth environments.( Cache, lazy-Loading, Minify CSS / Script / CDN / Gzip)
