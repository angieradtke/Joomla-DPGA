# **Working together **

The Joomla community is made up of many volunteers and dedicated contributors who work on the project with a lot of passion. Sometimes discussions can become heated or emotional because different opinions and strong beliefs come into play. To ensure that everyone interacts respectfully and no one feels threatened by harassment or inappropriate behavior, clear rules and mechanisms are in place to protect community members.

## **How Does the Joomla Community Protect Against Harassment?**

The Joomla community has a Code of Conduct that explicitly requires respectful behavior and prohibits any form of harassment, discrimination, or hate speech. Users and contributors can easily and confidentially report incidents through dedicated email addresses or contact forms. Community management and the Conflict Resolution Working Group review these reports and respond appropriately â€” ranging from conversations and warnings to exclusion from the community.

Technical tools such as blocking or muting users help avoid direct contact with unwanted individuals. Additionally, support is available for affected persons, and educational resources help raise awareness about fostering a positive and respectful environment.

## **What is the Conflict Resolution Working Group**

The  **Conflict Resolution Working Group**  is a volunteer group of experienced community members who specifically focus on resolving conflicts within the Joomla community. Because many participants are involved with passion and commitment, disagreements can sometimes escalate or become personal. The CRWG serves as a neutral, confidential point of contact that receives, assesses, and mediates complaints about harassment or violations of the Code of Conduct in a fair manner.

The goal of the CRWG is to maintain peace and safety within the community so that all contributors feel comfortable and can collaborate productively.
